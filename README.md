I redesigned the page to make it look more fresh, warm, and easy to use. I kept the same main colors so it still feels like Chai Point, but added yellow buttons to make it more lively and catch the userâ€™s eye. I used clean fonts and nice images to make the design look modern, friendly, and connected to the feeling of drinking chai.
